# Market Basket Analysis Using Apriori Algorithm & Association Rule

## Project Overview

Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is a **data mining technique** used to discover patterns in transaction datasets — specifically, which items are *frequently purchased together*. 

In this project, we use the **Apriori algorithm** to extract **frequent itemsets** and generate **association rules** that describe relationships between products. 

These insights are valuable for **retail analytics, cross-selling strategies, and product placement optimization**.

## Metrics Explained

| Metric         | Meaning                                                                          |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Support**    | How often an itemset appears in the dataset.                                     |
| **Confidence** | Likelihood of purchasing item B if item A is bought.                             |
| **Lift**       | Measures how much more likely item B is bought with A compared to random chance. |
